# Document-Categorization-Machine learning

* Dataset Used : 20 Newsgroup (20 NG - http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/ )

* Document Representation models used : Bag of words(BOW), Term Frequency(TF) weighting and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) weighting

* Classifiers Build : 
1) Naive Bayes
2) K-Nearest Neighbour
3) Support Vector Machine

* Result : SVM along with TF-IDF ( data split with stratified K-Fold algorithm with K=5) performs best with 89.2 % accuracy.

* Tools Used : Scikit Learn
* Programming Language : Python
